# AWS-Practical-Data-Science
-Develop and scaling data science projects into the cloud using Amazon SageMaker.  
-This Specialization is designed for data-focused developers, scientists, and analysts familiar with the Python and SQL programming languages who want to learn how to build, train, and deploy scalable, end-to-end ML pipelines - both automated and human-in-the-loop - in the AWS cloud.

Applied Learning Project
Specialization focused the following skills, you will be ready to:
 
• Ingest, register, and explore datasets

• Detect statistical bias in a dataset

• Automatically train and select models with AutoML

• Create machine learning features from raw data

• Save and manage features in a feature store

• Train and evaluate models using built-in algorithms and custom BERT models

• Debug, profile, and compare models to improve performance

• Build and run a complete ML pipeline end-to-end

• Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning

• Deploy and monitor models

• Perform data labeling at scale

• Build a human-in-the-loop pipeline to improve model performance

• Reduce cost and improve performance of data products
